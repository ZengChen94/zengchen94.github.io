      <p>After about 3-month seeking for internship, I finially decide to join in Google next summer and will play as an Software Engineering Intern in Google Play. In this process, I apply for more than 50 positions and get about 10 feedback. After the interview process, 4 offer comes into being and I decide to take the one from Google.</p>

<p>Here are some timeline, experience and conclusion for the preparing and interview process.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Here I only include those timeline of applications I get feedback, while most of the other applications reject me and ask me to move on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goldman Sachs: OA –&gt; Digital Interview –&gt; Onsite (Dallas, 2 rounds) –&gt; Offer</li>
  <li>Pure Storage: OA –&gt; Phone Interview (2 rounds) –&gt; Onsite (Mountain View, 3 rounds) –&gt; Offer</li>
  <li>Google: OA –&gt; Phone Interview (2 rounds) –&gt; Team Match –&gt; Offer (accept)</li>
  <li>Airbnb –&gt; OA –&gt; OA Follow-up –&gt; Phone Interview (2 rounds) –&gt; Reject</li>
  <li>PWC –&gt; Phone Interview (2 rounds) –&gt; Reject</li>
  <li>IBM –&gt; Phone Interview (1 rounds) –&gt; Offer</li>
  <li>Schlumberger –&gt; On Campus Interview (1 round) –&gt; Reject</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>Among these interviews, the best experience is from Google and Pure Storage.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about Google first, and this is the one I decide to join. The interview process is pretty pure, which means the interviewer pay most attention on how smart you are but not only on what you can do by this stage. The problems are flexible and concentrate on your familarity on fundemental knowledge, especially on data structure and algorithm. They ususally add some follow up on the basic problems to challenge you step by step. Anyway, the experice makes me feel comfortable and straightforward.</p>

<p>As for pure storage, it’s another great experience. The onsite interviewers are quiet cool and one of them even talks about sport with me at the last of the interview. Coming back to the interview itself, the problem are abstracted from the real use and are easily to be related to computer system. The most amazing feeling is that when I solve the puzzles with their engineers step by step, it makes me just feel like that I’m working with them. I can say that the engineer culture here is positive and attractive. Without Google, I will surely join them, but the problem is that I get Google.</p>

<p>Comparing with these two interviews, other interviews are either not that interesting or some are even unreasonable. Although I appreciate a lot for their trust and give me the opportunities to at least talk with them, I have to admit the experience of their interview are not so impressive.</p>

<p>After going through these interviews, I can strongly sense that the culture of a company can be expected from it’s interview process and they are positive correlation. If you find your interviewer seems to be very upset, how can you imagine this company can bring happiness to it’s employee? If you find the interview process is unordered, how can you imagine this company are managed well? And if you find you are rejected pretty unreasonable and get no explaination even no reply, how can you imagine this company has a reasonable judge system and basic respect for it’s emplyees? The fact is that I’ve experienced them all, and I don’t like these.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here I want to conclude some lessons for the later job-seeking process, although I prefer to stay at Google as a fulltime engineer if it’s possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply as soon as possible</li>
  <li>Apply as many as possible</li>
  <li>Get about 2-3 interviews on your hand at any time. Don’t make this number be too much or too less.</li>
  <li>Hightech-companies is much preferred to nontech-conpanies. In consider of the welfare and career development, they worth your joining in.</li>
  <li>Practice Leetcode as much as possible in the first stage of your preparation process for job-seeking. When it comes to the interview process of a specific company, please concentrate on the tags of that specific company.</li>
  <li>Construct your own social network. Get great relations with your friends, seniors, or any people in your area. It’s beneficial for both your career and your life.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>Sincerely, I want to appreciate all of my friends in the process. Coming from the process of application for graduate school, I’ve get to know too many outstanding friends and I always feel like we are all fighting together, no matter apply for graduate school or internship. I feel so luck that I’m not alone because of all your help. Of course, I won’t forget the help from seniors and connections on Linkedin, it’s you who give me the chance to get the interview and your encourage are always my power to move forward.</p>

<p>Thank you all and good luck.</p>
