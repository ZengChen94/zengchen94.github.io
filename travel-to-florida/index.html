      <p>This post is to record the travel of visiting Florida, including Miami, Key West, and Orlando. We 5 college friends meet at Florida in this christmas holiday at Florida and have a incrediable magic trip.</p>

<h2 id="day1-dec-19th-miami">Day1 (Dec. 19th, Miami)</h2>
<h3 id="flights-from-houston--los-angeles--orlando--atlanta--new-york-to-miami">Flights from Houston / Los Angeles / Orlando / Atlanta / New York to Miami</h3>

<p>After about two-month plan making, we finally met together at Miami. This day is just for gathering together and we came to Lincoln Road, the downtown of Miami Beach for the dinner. The unexpected thing is that we suddenly found the night view here was pretty great and the atmosphere of christmas here could be easily sensed from it’s light display. Therefore, we spent the whole night here for sightseeing and shopping. This is the first beginning of our reunion trip.</p>

<!-- ![Night of Miami Beach](/assets/img/2017-12-17-travel-to-florida/IMG_2734.JPG)

<h2 id="day2-dec-20th-miami">Day2 (Dec. 20th, Miami)</h2>
<h3 id="vizcaya-museum--gardens">Vizcaya Museum &amp; Gardens</h3>
<p>We orginally planed to visited the Little Havana in this morning. But after reviewing the comments for attractions from mafengwo, we changed our target to Vizcaya Museum &amp; Gardens and it later proved that this decision was absolutely brilliant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vizcaya was created as James Deering’s subtropical winter home in the 1910s and today it is a National Historic Landmark and accredited museum. (http://vizcaya.org/about.asp)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to my understanding, there are about two parts of it. One is the palace itself and another is it’s outside view, consisting of sea, statures and garden. I like the outside view most, where we can also find lizard on the road there. The secenery here is just like the one we can only find in the drawing before and everyone visit here can strongly sense that all the things including sky, sea, building, animals, trees, even we human-beings, etc. are joint together and seems to be incrediable harmonious.</p>

<p>Another amazing perspective of view is that when we sightsee the outside sea from the inside building, the mirror doors make everthing to be blue, and at the same time, also to be magical.</p>

<h3 id="bayside">Bayside</h3>
<p>This area is for the sightseeing of harbour. If you want to have a further trip on the sea and take the boat to play furry, here would be the place for your departure.</p>

<p>We chose to take the lunch at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. here and it ranked the 1st place on yelp in this area. The shrimp here was delicious and I’d like to recommend it.</p>

<p>The thing that attracts me most here is the American Airlines Center, which is the home of Miami Heats is located here and we can take a picture which can include it with the harbour. Here is another amazing image which inlcudes the seagull, sea, all kinds of boats, the Arena, and etc.</p>

<h3 id="miami-beach">Miami Beach</h3>
<p>Because of the limited of time, we didn’t visit the most famous South Beach and only visited Miami Beach which was near our hotel. The beach was still beautiful, although the people here were not too many, making the beach seemed to be a little bit deserted. Maybe the atmosphere of South Beach is better and it’s a pitty that we didn’t visit that this time.</p>

<h3 id="chalan-on-the-beach">Chalan On the Beach</h3>
<p>This restaurant is highly recommended and it provides traditional Southern American sea food.</p>

<h2 id="day3-dec-21st-key-west">Day3 (Dec. 21st, Key West)</h2>
<h3 id="drive-from-miami-to-key-west-3-hours">Drive from Miami to Key West (3 hours)</h3>
<p>It was such a long driving and we drove along a single road to Key Wesy, which is the southest place of the U.S. I drove about 1 hour and this was the first time I drove this far. The secenery along the US-1 was as beautiful as California State Route 1 I visited in 2016 summer. Unfortunately, it was pretty hard to be photoed that beacutiful view and maybe that’s why we should always view the beautiful nature by our own steps.</p>

<h3 id="little-white-house">Little White House</h3>
<p>This is the building visited by many presidents of the U.S. many times, especially Truman. It’s not so attractive to me too much and we just listen to the guidance talking about the stories of Truman. However, it’s charged the one who is interested in history should try this.</p>

<h3 id="sunset-on-mallory-square">Sunset on Mallory Square</h3>
<p>Sunset on Mallory Square is very famous. The cultrue here are from mostly Cuba and that’s the special. There are many shows on Mallory Square before the sunset begins and as time goes by, many people crowed here together for the sunset. As sunset falls into the horizon and the night comes, all kinds of bar begins their work and this is the most busy time in the day. However, I don’t recommend these bars for meal and they are mainly for fun. The Caroline is great and we tried it at noon. This restraunt provides meal from Cuba.</p>

<p>In the midnight, we had midnight snack together and discussed about the scheddule in the next day. All of this seems like that we come back to the university time again.</p>

<h2 id="day4-dec-22nd-key-west">Day4 (Dec. 22nd, Key West)</h2>
<h3 id="ernest-hemingway-house">Ernest Hemingway House</h3>
<p>We only viewed the outyard of it and didn’t enter in. Maybe we were just too frustrated with Little White House and these two were pretty similar. To those who loves cats, there are many cats in this site.</p>

<h3 id="southernmost-point">Southernmost Point</h3>
<p>Many people will wait in a long line for a photo taking with Southernmost Point and we just directly drove back to Miami.</p>

<h3 id="trump-national-doral-miami">Trump National Doral Miami</h3>
<p>This hotel is the luxurious hotel we’ve ever stayed in. And it’s designed for golf players and resorts. It just works as a manor and includes all the things you can imagine. As you stepped in this palace, you can feel like you are on a vacation and you are here just for relax. If there is special coupon for this hotel, it’s recommented for a trial because it’s very different from other premium hotel, inculding Hilton, Sheraton, etc. Here you live in a garden, but not a hotel.</p>

<h2 id="day5-dec-23rd-miami">Day5 (Dec. 23rd, Miami)</h2>
<h3 id="everglades-national-park">Everglades National Park</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everglades National Park protects an unparalleled landscape that provides important habitat for numerous rare and endangered species like the manatee,  American crocodile, and the elusive Florida panther.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the first National Park I visit. Now I know that as for the beautiful pictures of Natioanl Park, it’s usually only a small part of it, while the rest of it may be pretty natural and not good-looking. Anyway, it’s the most original one and this is the chance for we to get in touch with nature closely.</p>

<p>Coming back to talk about the Everglades National Park, this is a National Park which are all swamp everywhere. Here lives flamingo, elegator, and crocodile. This is the only place in the world you can see elegator and crocodile lives together. Unluckily we didn’t find these few species and we were even heavily attacked by mosquito and muddy road. Despite of this, I do still love this place and I enjoy the feeling of living with nature.</p>

<p>One thing I need to mention here is that our car was pulled over here by police. Because we drove 72 miles per hour, while the limit was 55 miles per hour. Luckily, the police we met was kind and just gave us an warning notice, but no punishment.</p>

<h3 id="wynwood">Wynwood</h3>
<p>This is the area for Street Artisc and we can find creative Street Artisc on every walls here. It’s not for traveling but it’s a part of the culture here. This would be an interesting experience if you visit here. Also, there are many strange but interesting cars here.</p>

<h3 id="flight-from-miami-to-orlando">Flight from Miami to Orlando</h3>
<p>This flight is so short that we were even not served for drinks.</p>

<h2 id="day6-dec-24th-orlando">Day6 (Dec. 24th, Orlando)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Walt Disney World Resort</li>
</ul>

<p>The trip in this day totally changes my opinions to amusement park. I orginally thought that this is just for kid, but now I myself also enjoyed it. More importantly, this day was Christmas Eve and that’s why the trip of this day was so special.</p>

<p>We came back at around 1am, which means we spent all of this day here. We tried every popular and classic programs here and recommended nearly every ride, especially Space Mountain, and Splash Water. The firework was special provided for Christmas and the theme was Happily Ever After. I could never compare it to any other firework I viewed before. This day was just totally a magical day and I didn’t how to describe it. As my friend said, when the parade shows, when the firework displays, and when the artificial snow falls, how can you stop the willing to cry? You are just in a magic world here.</p>

<p>Anyway, I highly recommended you to bring with your friends here. Nobody will dislike Disney.</p>

<h2 id="day7-dec-25th-orlando">Day7 (Dec. 25th, Orlando)</h2>
<h3 id="universal-studios-florida">Universal Studios Florida</h3>

<p>The programs here are much more thriller than programs in Disney. I enjoyed it, especially Transformers and Mummy. The technologies used here are incrediable amazing, making the feeling to be so real. Here are my recommendations as below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recommented Programs

<h2 id="day8-dec-26th-orlando">Day8 (Dec. 26th, Orlando)</h2>
<h3 id="seaworld-orlando">SeaWorld Orlando</h3>

<p>Believe in me, the SeaWorld’s signature killer whale show is amazing and you can never forget it once you join it, especially you sit in the front seats. You will taste the welcome from killer whale and the smell of sea. Don’t ask me about how I know it, lol.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Also, believe in me, the rollar coaster here is amazing. It’s much more higher and thriller than any other place, maybe only except for six flags. The most important thing is that the roller coaster here is combined with VR, making the experience to be very unique. Here is the reference</p>
<blockquote>

<p>To conclude, this Sea World is unique.</p>

<h3 id="red-lobster">Red Lobster</h3>
<p>The meal is delicious but I don’t think the taste is unique. And the awful waiter made me think negative of this restaurant.</p>

<h3 id="orlando-international-premium-outlets">Orlando International Premium Outlets</h3>
<p>It’s big but not as great as we expect before.</p>

<p>Coming from Florida back to Houston, the season switches from Summer to Winter. Hope our freiendship won’t be this cold as time goes by and may it continues to be as shining as the sunshine in Florida.</p>
