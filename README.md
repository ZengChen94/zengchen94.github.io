## Usage
1. Download and install dependencies. Make sure you have installed `ruby`, `gem`, `bundle` and `jekyll`.

```bash
bundle install
```

2. After modifying or adding articles in `./_posts`, use the following command to rebuild. Generated static files can be found in `./_site`.

```bash
jekyll build
```

Or, run as a local web server:

```bash
jekyll serve watch
```
